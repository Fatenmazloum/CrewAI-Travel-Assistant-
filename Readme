Create and build a crew that acts as a travel assistant (Typical example for CrewAI)

After taking the request from the user, it has to:

Check flights [ you can make this as a dummy function that returns random flights]

Check hotels and give suggestions [you can use gemini api for example, tell it to generate dummy data] 

Prepare a tourism tour in the country they are going to

give them advices

Make sure to use CrewAI. You can use Agents and Tasks as you wish, no limitations.

You can also add any other option you see is a good fit for this use case
